## General Information

    A consumer finance company specializing in lending various loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide on loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

    If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business for the company
    If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is expected to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss to the company
